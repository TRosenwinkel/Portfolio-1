      </h3>
      <p>I'm from a small town named Corning in upstate NY. I have worked in for a local credit union in the Corning area for 3 years and in that time have help a hew different job titles. I started at the credit union as a teller and soon moved to IT where I began as a Client Support Specialist and was promoted to Ssytems Administrator. I have been in my current role for about a year and love the learning that comes along with the job.</p>

      <p>
        My career track so far has been somewhat unconventional. I earned a bachelors in history from Mansfield University and soon found out that there isn't exactly a booming job market for historians in the Corning area. I have often thought about going beyond the upstate NY area to find a job but Corning is too nice to leave. This led me to find a full time job at the credit union, where I soon found an interest in technology.

        I love the challenges that a career in tech brings, there is always something new to learn and I have grown to become a good problem solver. This is what has led me to pursue a career as a web developer. There is an endless amount of problem sovling, and something that I have grown to really appreciate is the creativity it alows me to use. Check out some of my projects by clicking the link above, I am constantly thinking of new things to add and ways to express my creative side.
